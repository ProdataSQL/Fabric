## 09 FabricDW sp_WhoIsActive
Monitoring TSQL Script for Fabric DW with similar output to https://whoisactive.com/ which is created and maintained by fellow MCM 
<a href="https://github.com/amachanic">Adam Machanic</a>, - probably the most widely used and known 3rd Party scripot for SqlDbEngine

If you haven't installed sp_WhoIsActive on all your SqlEbEngine, then its a must install. Adam's code is a master class in 
design, TSQL coding and extensibility. A lesson in how to go from a basic script to a swiss army knife for instant performance and monitoring ;-)

This Fabric DW script just shows exec requests, sessions and SQL Statements. When coming from SqlDbEngine this adds some familiarity to monitoring.

This has moved to a dedicated repos as below
